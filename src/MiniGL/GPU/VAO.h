     * \param type Data Type @see GLUtils::DataType
     * \param offset Offset from the beginning of the buffer
     * \param tupleSize The number of elements of each vertex: if we are reading triangles, we read our vertices 3 by 3, so 3.
     * if we were to render lines, it would be 2.
     * \param stride Space between 2 values. Will be non-null if we pack multiple datas.
     * We could for instance choose to pack Mesh datas like so:
     * VERTEX UV NORMAL VERTEX UV NORMAL VERTEX UV NORMAL
     * in which case we will have 3 attributes, each with a different stride: For Vertex it will be sizeof(UV) + sizeof(NORMAL).
     * If we were to pack our data like so:
     * VERTEX VERTEX VERTEX UV UV UV NORMAL NORMAL NORMAL
     * We would have no stride, as all vertices are packed together, but we would have an offset: the Normals attribute would have
     * an offset of sizeof(VERTEX) * vertexCount + sizeof(UV) * vertexCount.
     * The first method has the advantage of faster memory access, since every vertex has all its data contiguous in memory.
     * The second method is conceptually simpler but a bit slower (this shouldn't be very noticeable honestly, but benchmark it!)
